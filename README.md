Tree Viewer is a Python command-line tool that allows you to view the contents of directories, zip files, and rar files in a tree-like structure. It provides an intuitive way to navigate and explore the directory structure of your files.

## How to Install

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/github-1970/tree-viewer.git

3. Install the required dependencies:

## How to Use

To use Tree Viewer, run the `tree_viewer.py` script from the command line, followed by the path to the target directory or zip/rar file you want to visualize.

Example usage:

1. View the contents of a directory:
   ```
   python tree_viewer.py /path/to/directory
   ```

   ```

3. View the contents of a rar file:

   ```

If the zip or rar file is encrypted, you will be prompted to enter the password (if required) to access its contents.
